# Feminism isâ€¦

## Exploring notions of feminism by asking the simple question, feminism is?
## Produced as part of the WOW hackathon in conjunction with the Women Of the World festival 2013 

A very simple site. Reads the quotes from a json file and outputs the results. Responses are capture by a Google form. Styling is Sass

My JS foo is very weak so please don't look at the code :) The Sass isn't to pretty either. 

This project was created by [Mark](https://twitter.com/M6_D6) for the Women Of the World
hackathon 2013 by [Rewired State](http://rewiredstate.org/) in collaboration with the [Women Of
the World festival 2013](http://wow.southbankcentre.co.uk/).
